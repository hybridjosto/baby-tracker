# Research: Wee Event Logging

## Decision: Extend event types to include "wee"

**Rationale**: Wee is a natural third event type in the same tracking flow, so
extending the existing type list avoids extra schema complexity.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Separate table for wee: unnecessary overhead for a single additional type.

## Decision: Add a third action button on the homepage

**Rationale**: Mirrors the existing one-tap feed/poo actions and keeps the flow
consistent.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Menu-based selection: slower and adds extra taps.
