Rationale: this is a family-only system\\nhandling sensitive health data.\\n\\n### Fast One-Hand Logging\\nLogging a feed or poo MUST be possible in a few taps with sensible defaults\\n(e.g., current time). The UI MUST avoid mandatory fields beyond event type,\\nso quick entries are possible during night or one-handed use. Rationale: ease\\nof use ensures consistent, accurate tracking.\\n\\n### Space-Efficient Event Log\\nEvents MUST be stored in a compact schema (SQLite or flat file) with an\\nappend-only event log mindset. Data SHOULD avoid redundant duplication and\\nfavor short enums/ints over verbose strings where feasible. Rationale: long\\nretention on low-power hardware needs predictable storage growth.\\n\\n### Resilient Offline Operation\\nThe app MUST tolerate intermittent connectivity between iPhones and the RPi,\\nwith clear error handling and safe retries. Writes MUST be idempotent or\\notherwise protected against duplicate submissions.

That will be a separate command.\n\n### Section Requirements\n\n- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature\n- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature\n- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as \"N/A\")\n\n### For AI Generation\n\nWhen creating this spec from a user prompt:\n\n1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps\n2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section\n3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:\n   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience\n   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications\n   - Lack any reasonable default\n4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n5. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the \"testable and unambiguous\" checklist item\n6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):\n   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)\n   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)\n   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)\n\n**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):\n\n- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain\n- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified\n- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks\n- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps\n- Integration patterns: RESTful APIs unless specified otherwise\n\n### Success Criteria Guidelines\n\nSuccess criteria must be:\n\n1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)\n2. **Technology-agnostic**: No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools\n3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals\n4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details\n\n**Good examples**:\n\n- \"Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes\"\n- \"System supports 10,000 concurrent users\"\n- \"95% of searches return results in under 1 second\"\n- \"Task completion rate improves by 40%\"\n\n**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):\n\n- \"API response time is under 200ms\" (too technical, use \"Users see results instantly\")\n- \"Database can handle 1000 TPS\" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)\n- \"React components render efficiently\" (framework-specific)\n- \"Redis cache hit rate above 80%\" (technology-specific)\n","images":[]}}

Rationale: this is a family-only system\nhandling sensitive health data.\n\n### Fast One-Hand Logging\nLogging a feed or poo MUST be possible in a few taps with sensible defaults\n(e.g., current time). The UI MUST avoid mandatory fields beyond event type,\nso quick entries are possible during night or one-handed use. Rationale: ease\nof use ensures consistent, accurate tracking.\n\n### Space-Efficient Event Log\nEvents MUST be stored in a compact schema (SQLite or flat file) with an\nappend-only event log mindset. Data SHOULD avoid redundant duplication and\nfavor short enums/ints over verbose strings where feasible. Rationale: long\nretention on low-power hardware needs predictable storage growth.\n\n### Resilient Offline Operation\nThe app MUST tolerate intermittent connectivity between iPhones and the RPi,\nwith clear error handling and safe retries. Writes MUST be idempotent or\notherwise protected against duplicate submissions. Rationale: home Wi-Fi and\nVPN connections are not always stable.\n\n### Operational Simplicity\nThe system MUST remain low-maintenance: minimal dependencies, a simple deploy\nstory on the RPi, and straightforward backups/exports. Rationale: the system\nshould be maintainable by parents without a full DevOps workflow.\n\n## Data & Storage Standards\n\n- The canonical record is an event with type (feed/poo), timestamp, and\n  optional attributes (amount, notes, tags).\n- Time MUST be stored unambiguously (ISO 8601 with timezone or UTC epoch).\n- Storage format MUST be documented and include a reliable export path (CSV\n  or JSON) for portability.\n- Data migrations MUST be explicit, reversible where possible, and run safely\n  on the RPi.\n\n## Delivery Workflow & Quality Gates\n\n- Every feature plan MUST include a Constitution Check and call out any\n  deviations with justification.\n- Schema changes MUST include a migration plan and backup/restore notes.\n- Any new dependency MUST be justified against the Operational Simplicity\n  principle and documented.\n\n## Governance\n\nThis constitution supersedes other development practices in this repository.\nAmendments require updating this file, documenting impact, and bumping the\nversion using semantic versioning: MAJOR for incompatible governance changes,\nMINOR for new principles/sections, PATCH for clarifications. Compliance is\nreviewed during planning (spec/plan templates) and at merge time.\n\n**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: TODO(RATIFICATION_DATE): original adoption date not provided | **Last Amended**: 2026-01-02\n"}}

All paths must be absolute. For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n2. **Load design documents**: Read from FEATURE_DIR:\n   - **Required**: plan.md (tech stack, libraries, structure), spec.md (user stories with priorities)\n   - **Optional**: data-model.md (entities), contracts/ (API endpoints), research.md (decisions), quickstart.md (test scenarios)\n   - Note: Not all projects have all documents. Generate tasks based on what's available.\n\n3. **Execute task generation workflow**:\n   - Load plan.md and extract tech stack, libraries, project structure\n   - Load spec.md and extract user stories with their priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.)\n   - If data-model.md exists: Extract entities and map to user stories\n   - If contracts/ exists: Map endpoints to user stories\n   - If research.md exists: Extract decisions for setup tasks\n   - Generate tasks organized by user story (see Task Generation Rules below)\n   - Generate dependency graph showing user story completion order\n   - Create parallel execution examples per user story\n   - Validate task completeness (each user story has all needed tasks, independently testable)\n\n4. **Generate tasks.md**: Use `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as structure, fill with:\n   - Correct feature name from plan.md\n   - Phase 1: Setup tasks (project initialization)\n   - Phase 2: Foundational tasks (blocking prerequisites for all user stories)\n   - Phase 3+: One phase per user story (in priority order from spec.md)\n   - Each phase includes: story goal, independent test criteria, tests (if requested), implementation tasks\n   - Final Phase: Polish & cross-cutting concerns\n   - All tasks must follow the strict checklist format (see Task Generation Rules below)\n   -

user story implementation can now begin in parallel\n\n---\n\n## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Two-Click Add (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP\n\n**Goal**: Two-tap feed/poo logging with idempotency\n\n**Independent Test**: From the home screen, open the app, tap Feed or Poo, and\nsee the new entry appear in the recent list\n\n### Implementation for User Story 1\n\n- [ ] T011 [P] [US1] Add entry validation helpers in `src/lib/validation.py`\n- [ ] T012 [US1] Add create-entry service logic in `src/app/services/entries.py`\n- [ ] T013 [US1] Implement POST `/api/entries` in `src/app/routes/entries.py`\n- [ ] T014 [US1] Create main UI template with two action buttons in `src/web/templates/index.html`\n- [ ] T015 [US1] Add client JS to submit feed/poo with idempotency key in `src/web/static/app.js`\n- [ ] T016 [US1] Add PWA manifest + icons reference in `src/web/static/manifest.json`\n\n**Checkpoint**: User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently\n\n---\n\n## Phase 4: User Story 2 - See Recent Activity (Priority: P2)\n\n**Goal**: Show recent feed/poo entries on app open\n\n**Independent Test**: Open the app and confirm recent entries appear in time order\n\n### Implementation for User Story 2\n\n- [ ] T017 [US2] Add list-entries service logic in `src/app/services/entries.py`\n- [ ] T018 [US2] Implement GET `/api/entries` in `src/app/routes/entries.py`\n- [ ] T019 [US2] Render recent list in `src/web/templates/index.html`\n- [ ] T020 [US2] Load and display recent list in `src/web/static/app.js`\n\n**Checkpoint**: User Story 2 should be functional and independently testable\n\n---\n\n## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Fix Mistakes (Priority: P3)\n\n**Goal**: Edit or delete a recent entry\n\n**Independent Test**: Update or remove an entry and verify the list reflects changes\n\n### Implementation for User Story 3\n\n- [ ] T021 [US3] Add update/delete service logic in `src/app/services/entries.py`\n- [ ] T022 [US3] Implement PATCH/DELETE `/api/entries/{id}` in `src/app/routes/entries.py`\n- [ ] T023 [US3] Add edit/delete UI actions in `src/web/templates/index.html`\n- [ ] T024 [US3] Wire edit/delete actions in `src/web/static/app.js`\n\n**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional\n\n---\n\n## Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns\n\n**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories\n\n- [ ] T025 [P] Update run/backup notes in `/Users/josh/my-code/baby/specs/001-two-click-log/quickstart.md`\n- [ ] T026 [P] Add top-level usage notes in `/Users/josh/my-code/baby/README.md`\n- [ ] T027 Run quickstart validation steps described in `/Users/josh/my-code/baby/specs/001-two-click-log/quickstart.md`\n\n---\n\n## Dependencies & Execution Order\n\n### Phase Dependencies\n\n- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately\n- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories\n- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion\n  - User stories can proceed in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)\n- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete\n\n### User Story Dependencies\n\n- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies\n- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependency on US1\n- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependency on US1/US2\n\n### Dependency Graph\n\n- Setup → Foundational → US1, US2, US3 → Polish\n\n## Parallel Execution Examples\n\n### User Story 1\n\n```text\nT011 (validation helpers) + T014 (UI template) + T016 (manifest) can run in parallel.\nT012 depends on T011. T013 depends on T012. T015 depends on T014 and T013.\n```\n\n### User Story 2\n\n```text\nT017 (list service) can run in parallel with T019 (UI list markup).\nT018 depends on T017. T020 depends on T018 and T019.\n```\n\n### User Story 3\n\n```text\nT021 (update/delete service) can run in parallel with T023 (UI actions).\nT022 depends on T021. T024 depends on T022 and T023.\n```\n\n## Implementation Strategy\n\n- Deliver MVP by completing US1 after Foundational tasks.\n- Add US2 to make the log immediately useful for daily coordination.\n- Add US3 for corrections once core logging and viewing are stable.\n"}}

Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions.\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/josh/my-code/baby/baby-tracker/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/josh/my-code/baby/baby-tracker/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n- Discovery: Available skills are listed in project docs and may also appear in a runtime \"## Skills\" section (name + description + file path). These are the sources of truth; skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Description as trigger: The YAML `description` in `SKILL.md` is the primary trigger signal; rely on it to decide applicability. If unsure, ask a brief clarification before proceeding.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deeply nested references; prefer one-hop files explicitly linked from `SKILL.md`.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"<environment_context>\n  <cwd>/Users/josh/my-code/baby/baby-tracker</cwd>\n  <approval_policy>on-request</approval_policy>\n  <sandbox_mode>workspace-write</sandbox_mode>\n  <network_access>restricted</network_access>\n  <shell>zsh</shell>\n</environment_context>"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"\n## User Input\n\n```text\nminimal baby feed and poo tracker webapp - hosted on rpi, exposed to parents iphones using tailscale. data stored in sensible format focusing on space efficiency, either flat file or sqlite db.\n```\n\nYou **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).\n\n## Outline\n\nYou are updating the project constitution at `.specify/memory/constitution.md`. This file is a TEMPLATE containing placeholder tokens in square brackets (e.g. `[PROJECT_NAME]`, `[PRINCIPLE_1_NAME]`). Your job is to (a) collect/derive concrete values, (b) fill the template precisely, and (c) propagate any amendments across dependent artifacts.\n\nFollow this execution flow:\n\n1. Load the existing constitution template at `.specify/memory/constitution.md`.\n   - Identify every placeholder token of the form `[ALL_CAPS_IDENTIFIER]`.\n   **IMPORTANT**: The user might require less or more principles than the ones used in the template. If a number is specified, respect that - follow the general template. You will update the doc accordingly.\n\n2. Collect/derive values for placeholders:\n   - If user input (conversation) supplies a value, use it.\n   - Otherwise infer from existing repo context (README, docs, prior constitution versions if embedded).\n   - For governance dates: `RATIFICATION_DATE` is the original adoption date (if unknown ask or mark TODO), `LAST_AMENDED_DATE` is today if changes are made, otherwise keep previous.\n   - `CONSTITUTION_VERSION` must increment according to semantic versioning rules:\n     - MAJOR: Backward incompatible governance/principle removals or redefinitions.\n     - MINOR: New principle/section added or materially expanded guidance.\n     - PATCH: Clarifications, wording, typo fixes, non-semantic refinements.\n   - If version bump type ambiguous, propose reasoning before finalizing.\n\n3. Draft the updated constitution content:\n   - Replace every placeholder with concrete text (no bracketed tokens left except intentionally retained template slots that the project has chosen not to define yet—explicitly justify any left).\n   - Preserve heading hierarchy and comments can be removed once replaced unless they still add clarifying guidance.\n   - Ensure each Principle section: succinct name line, paragraph (or bullet list) capturing non‑negotiable rules, explicit rationale if not obvious.\n   - Ensure Governance section lists amendment procedure, versioning policy, and compliance review expectations.\n\n4. Consistency propagation checklist (convert prior checklist into active validations):\n   - Read `.specify/templates/plan-template.md` and ensure any \"Constitution Check\" or rules align with updated principles.\n   - Read `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` for scope/requirements alignment—update if constitution adds/removes mandatory sections or constraints.\n   - Read `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` and ensure task categorization reflects new or removed principle-driven task types (e.g., observability, versioning, testing discipline).\n   - Read each command file in `.specify/templates/commands/*.md` (including this one) to verify no outdated references (agent-specific names like CLAUDE only) remain when generic guidance is required.\n   - Read any runtime guidance docs (e.g., `README.md`, `docs/quickstart.md`, or agent-specific guidance files if present). Update references to principles changed.\n\n5. Produce a Sync Impact Report (prepend as an HTML comment at top of the constitution file after update):\n   - Version change: old → new\n   - List of modified principles (old title → new title if renamed)\n   - Added sections\n   - Removed sections\n   - Templates requiring updates (✅ updated / ⚠ pending) with file paths\n   - Follow-up TODOs if any placeholders intentionally deferred.\n\n6. Validation before final output:\n   - No remaining unexplained bracket tokens.\n   - Version line matches report.\n   - Dates ISO format YYYY-MM-DD.\n   - Principles are declarative, testable, and free of vague language (\"should\" → replace with MUST/SHOULD rationale where appropriate).\n\n7. Write the completed constitution back to `.specify/memory/constitution.md` (overwrite).\n\n8. Output a final summary to the user with:\n   - New version and bump rationale.\n   - Any files flagged for manual follow-up.\n   - Suggested commit message (e.g., `docs: amend constitution to vX.Y.Z (principle additions + governance update)`).\n\nFormatting & Style Requirements:\n\n- Use Markdown headings exactly as in the template (do not demote/promote levels).\n- Wrap long rationale lines to keep readability (<100 chars ideally) but do not hard enforce with awkward breaks.\n- Keep a single blank line between sections.\n- Avoid trailing whitespace.\n\nIf the user supplies partial updates (e.g., only one principle revision), still perform validation and version decision steps.\n\nIf critical info missing (e.g., ratification date truly unknown), insert `TODO(<FIELD_NAME>): explanation` and include in the Sync Impact Report under deferred items.\n\nDo not create a new template; always operate on the existing `.specify/memory/constitution.md` file.\n"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"what storage method would work best here?"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"\n## User Input\n\n```text\nBabypoo and feeding tracker web app privately hosted on a Raspberry Pi feature should be two click to add items.

So one click to open the app from the phone home page, second click to add either a poo or a feed item using SQL light to store the data and using tail scale to expose the url to the` appears literally below. Do not ask the user to repeat it unless they provided an empty command.\n\nGiven that feature description, do this:\n\n1. **Generate a concise short name** (2-4 words) for the branch:\n   - Analyze the feature description and extract the most meaningful keywords\n   - Create a 2-4 word short name that captures the essence of the feature\n   - Use action-noun format when possible (e.g., \"add-user-auth\", \"fix-payment-bug\")\n   - Preserve technical terms and acronyms (OAuth2, API, JWT, etc.)\n   - Keep it concise but descriptive enough to understand the feature at a glance\n   - Examples:\n     - \"I want to add user authentication\" → \"user-auth\"\n     - \"Implement OAuth2 integration for the API\" → \"oauth2-api-integration\"\n     - \"Create a dashboard for analytics\" → \"analytics-dashboard\"\n     - \"Fix payment processing timeout bug\" → \"fix-payment-timeout\"\n\n2. **Check for existing branches before creating new one**:\n\n   a. First, fetch all remote branches to ensure we have the latest information:\n\n      ```bash\n      git fetch --all --prune\n      ```\n\n   b. Find the highest feature number across all sources for the short-name:\n      - Remote branches: `git ls-remote --heads origin | grep -E 'refs/heads/[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Local branches: `git branch | grep -E '^[* ]*[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Specs directories: Check for directories matching `specs/[0-9]+-<short-name>`\n\n   c. Determine the next available number:\n      - Extract all numbers from all three sources\n      - Find the highest number N\n      - Use N+1 for the new branch number\n\n   d. Run the script `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"Babypoo and feeding tracker web app privately hosted on a Raspberry Pi feature should be two click to add items. So one click to open the app from the phone home page, second click to add either a poo or a feed item using SQL light to store the data and using tail scale to expose the url to the\"` with the calculated number and short-name:\n      - Pass `--number N+1` and `--short-name \"your-short-name\"` along with the feature description\n      - Bash example: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"Babypoo and feeding tracker web app privately hosted on a Raspberry Pi feature should be two click to add items.

Load `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` to understand required sections.\n\n4. Follow this execution flow:\n\n    1. Parse user description from Input\n       If empty: ERROR \"No feature description provided\"\n    2. Extract key concepts from description\n       Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints\n    3. For unclear aspects:\n       - Make informed guesses based on context and industry standards\n       - Only mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] if:\n         - The choice significantly impacts feature scope or user experience\n         - Multiple reasonable interpretations exist with different implications\n         - No reasonable default exists\n       - **LIMIT: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers total**\n       - Prioritize clarifications by impact: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n    4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section\n       If no clear user flow: ERROR \"Cannot determine user scenarios\"\n    5. Generate Functional Requirements\n       Each requirement must be testable\n       Use reasonable defaults for unspecified details (document assumptions in Assumptions section)\n    6. Define Success Criteria\n       Create measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes\n       Include both quantitative metrics (time, performance, volume) and qualitative measures (user satisfaction, task completion)\n       Each criterion must be verifiable without implementation details\n    7. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)\n    8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)\n\n5. Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.\n\n6. **Specification Quality Validation**: After writing the initial spec, validate it against quality criteria:\n\n   a. **Create Spec Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/requirements.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:\n\n      ```markdown\n      # Specification Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]\n      \n      **Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning\n      **Created**: [DATE]\n      **Feature**: [Link to spec.md]\n      \n      ## Content Quality\n      \n      - [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)\n      - [ ] Focused on user value and business needs\n      - [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders\n      - [ ] All mandatory sections completed\n      \n      ## Requirement Completeness\n      \n      - [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain\n      - [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous\n      - [ ] Success criteria are measurable\n      - [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)\n      - [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined\n      - [ ] Edge cases are identified\n      - [ ] Scope is clearly bounded\n      - [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified\n      \n      ## Feature Readiness\n      \n      - [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria\n      - [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows\n      - [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria\n      - [ ] No implementation details leak into specification\n      \n      ## Notes\n      \n      - Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`\n      ```\n\n   b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the spec against each checklist item:\n      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails\n      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant spec sections)\n\n   c. **Handle Validation Results**:\n\n      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 6\n\n      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:\n        1. List the failing items and specific issues\n        2. Update the spec to address each issue\n        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)\n        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user\n\n      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:\n        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the spec\n        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/security/UX impact) and make informed guesses for the rest\n        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:\n\n           ```markdown\n           ## Question [N]: [Topic]\n           \n           **Context**: [Quote relevant spec section]\n           \n           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]\n           \n           **Suggested Answers**:\n           \n           | Option | Answer | Implications |\n           |--------|--------|--------------|\n           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |\n           \n           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_\n           ```\n\n        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:\n           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned\n           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`\n           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`\n           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview\n        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)\n        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses\n        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., \"Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B\")\n        8. Update the spec by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer\n        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved\n\n   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status\n\n7. Report completion with branch name, spec file path, checklist results, and readiness for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).\n\n**NOTE:** The script creates and checks out the new branch and initializes the spec file before writing.\n\n## General Guidelines\n\n## Quick Guidelines\n\n- Focus on **WHAT** users need and **WHY**.\n- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure).\n- Written for business stakeholders, not developers.\n- DO NOT create any checklists that are embedded in the spec. That will be a separate command.\n\n### Section Requirements\n\n- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature\n- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature\n- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as \"N/A\")\n\n### For AI Generation\n\nWhen creating this spec from a user prompt:\n\n1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps\n2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section\n3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:\n   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience\n   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications\n   - Lack any reasonable default\n4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n5. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the \"testable and unambiguous\" checklist item\n6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):\n   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)\n   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)\n   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)\n\n**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):\n\n- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain\n- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified\n- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks\n- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps\n- Integration patterns: RESTful APIs unless specified otherwise\n\n### Success Criteria Guidelines\n\nSuccess criteria must be:\n\n1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)\n2. **Technology-agnostic**: No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools\n3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals\n4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details\n\n**Good examples**:\n\n- \"Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes\"\n- \"System supports 10,000 concurrent users\"\n- \"95% of searches return results in under 1 second\"\n- \"Task completion rate improves by 40%\"\n\n**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):\n\n- \"API response time is under 200ms\" (too technical, use \"Users see results instantly\")\n- \"Database can handle 1000 TPS\" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)\n- \"React components render efficiently\" (framework-specific)\n- \"Redis cache hit rate above 80%\" (technology-specific)\n"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"\n## User Input\n\n```text\n\n```\n\nYou **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).\n\n## Outline\n\n1. **Setup**: Run `.specify/scripts/bash/setup-plan.sh --json` from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_SPEC, IMPL_PLAN, SPECS_DIR, BRANCH. For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n2. **Load context**: Read FEATURE_SPEC and `.specify/memory/constitution.md`. Load IMPL_PLAN template (already copied).\n\n3. **Execute plan workflow**: Follow the structure in IMPL_PLAN template to:\n   - Fill Technical Context (mark unknowns as \"NEEDS CLARIFICATION\")\n   - Fill Constitution Check section from constitution\n   - Evaluate gates (ERROR if violations unjustified)\n   - Phase 0: Generate research.md (resolve all NEEDS CLARIFICATION)\n   - Phase 1: Generate data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md\n   - Phase 1: Update agent context by running the agent script\n   - Re-evaluate Constitution Check post-design\n\n4. **Stop and report**: Command ends after Phase 2 planning. Report branch, IMPL_PLAN path, and generated artifacts.\n\n## Phases\n\n### Phase 0: Outline & Research\n\n1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:\n   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task\n   - For each dependency → best practices task\n   - For each integration → patterns task\n\n2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:\n\n   ```text\n   For each unknown in Technical Context:\n     Task: \"Research {unknown} for {feature context}\"\n   For each technology choice:\n     Task: \"Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:\n   - Decision: [what was chosen]\n   - Rationale: [why chosen]\n   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]\n\n**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved\n\n### Phase 1: Design & Contracts\n\n**Prerequisites:** `research.md` complete\n\n1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:\n   - Entity name, fields, relationships\n   - Validation rules from requirements\n   - State transitions if applicable\n\n2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:\n   - For each user action → endpoint\n   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns\n   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`\n\n3. **Agent context update**:\n   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh codex`\n   - These scripts detect which AI agent is in use\n   - Update the appropriate agent-specific context file\n   - Add only new technology from current plan\n   - Preserve manual additions between markers\n\n**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, quickstart.md, agent-specific file\n\n## Key rules\n\n- Use absolute paths\n- ERROR on gate failures or unresolved clarifications\n"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"\n## User Input\n\n```text\n\n```\n\nYou **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).\n\n## Outline\n\n1. **Setup**: Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json` from repo root and parse FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list. All paths must be absolute. For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n2. **Load design documents**: Read from FEATURE_DIR:\n   - **Required**: plan.md (tech stack, libraries, structure), spec.md (user stories with priorities)\n   - **Optional**: data-model.md (entities), contracts/ (API endpoints), research.md (decisions), quickstart.md (test scenarios)\n   - Note: Not all projects have all documents. Generate tasks based on what's available.\n\n3. **Execute task generation workflow**:\n   - Load plan.md and extract tech stack, libraries, project structure\n   - Load spec.md and extract user stories with their priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.)\n   - If data-model.md exists: Extract entities and map to user stories\n   - If contracts/ exists: Map endpoints to user stories\n   - If research.md exists: Extract decisions for setup tasks\n   - Generate tasks organized by user story (see Task Generation Rules below)\n   - Generate dependency graph showing user story completion order\n   - Create parallel execution examples per user story\n   - Validate task completeness (each user story has all needed tasks, independently testable)\n\n4. **Generate tasks.md**: Use `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as structure, fill with:\n   - Correct feature name from plan.md\n   - Phase 1: Setup tasks (project initialization)\n   - Phase 2: Foundational tasks (blocking prerequisites for all user stories)\n   - Phase 3+: One phase per user story (in priority order from spec.md)\n   - Each phase includes: story goal, independent test criteria, tests (if requested), implementation tasks\n   - Final Phase: Polish & cross-cutting concerns\n   - All tasks must follow the strict checklist format (see Task Generation Rules below)\n   - Clear file paths for each task\n   - Dependencies section showing story completion order\n   - Parallel execution examples per story\n   - Implementation strategy section (MVP first, incremental delivery)\n\n5. **Report**: Output path to generated tasks.md and summary:\n   - Total task count\n   - Task count per user story\n   - Parallel opportunities identified\n   - Independent test criteria for each story\n   - Suggested MVP scope (typically just User Story 1)\n   - Format validation: Confirm ALL tasks follow the checklist format (checkbox, ID, labels, file paths)\n\nContext for task generation: \n\nThe tasks.md should be immediately executable - each task must be specific enough that an LLM can complete it without additional context.\n\n## Task Generation Rules\n\n**CRITICAL**: Tasks MUST be organized by user story to enable independent implementation and testing.\n\n**Tests are OPTIONAL**: Only generate test tasks if explicitly requested in the feature specification or if user requests TDD approach.\n\n### Checklist Format (REQUIRED)\n\nEvery task MUST strictly follow this format:\n\n```text\n- [ ] [TaskID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path\n```\n\n**Format Components**:\n\n1. **Checkbox**: ALWAYS start with `- [ ]` (markdown checkbox)\n2. **Task ID**: Sequential number (T001, T002, T003...) in execution order\n3. **[P] marker**: Include ONLY if task is parallelizable (different files, no dependencies on incomplete tasks)\n4. **[Story] label**: REQUIRED for user story phase tasks only\n   - Format: [US1], [US2], [US3], etc. (maps to user stories from spec.md)\n   - Setup phase: NO story label\n   - Foundational phase: NO story label  \n   - User Story phases: MUST have story label\n   - Polish phase: NO story label\n5. **Description**: Clear action with exact file path\n\n**Examples**:\n\n- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan`\n- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T005 [P] Implement authentication middleware in src/middleware/auth.py`\n- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T012 [P] [US1] Create User model in src/models/user.py`\n- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T014 [US1] Implement UserService in src/services/user_service.py`\n- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] Create User model` (missing ID and Story label)\n- ❌ WRONG: `T001 [US1] Create model` (missing checkbox)\n- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] [US1] Create User model` (missing Task ID)\n- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] T001 [US1] Create model` (missing file path)\n\n### Task Organization\n\n1. **From User Stories (spec.md)** - PRIMARY ORGANIZATION:\n   - Each user story (P1, P2, P3...) gets its own phase\n   - Map all related components to their story:\n     - Models needed for that story\n     - Services needed for that story\n     - Endpoints/UI needed for that story\n     - If tests requested: Tests specific to that story\n   - Mark story dependencies (most stories should be independent)\n\n2. **From Contracts**:\n   - Map each contract/endpoint → to the user story it serves\n   - If tests requested: Each contract → contract test task [P] before implementation in that story's phase\n\n3. **From Data Model**:\n   - Map each entity to the user story(ies) that need it\n   - If entity serves multiple stories: Put in earliest story or Setup phase\n   - Relationships → service layer tasks in appropriate story phase\n\n4. **From Setup/Infrastructure**:\n   - Shared infrastructure → Setup phase (Phase 1)\n   - Foundational/blocking tasks → Foundational phase (Phase 2)\n   - Story-specific setup → within that story's phase\n\n### Phase Structure\n\n- **Phase 1**: Setup (project initialization)\n- **Phase 2**: Foundational (blocking prerequisites - MUST complete before user stories)\n- **Phase 3+**: User Stories in priority order (P1, P2, P3...)\n  - Within each story: Tests (if requested) → Models → Services → Endpoints → Integration\n  - Each phase should be a complete, independently testable increment\n- **Final Phase**: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns\n"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"\n## User Input\n\n```text\n\n```\n\nYou **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).\n\n## Outline\n\n1.

Load and analyze the implementation context:\n   - **REQUIRED**: Read tasks.md for the complete task list and execution plan\n   - **REQUIRED**: Read plan.md for tech stack, architecture, and file structure\n   - **IF EXISTS**: Read data-model.md for entities and relationships\n   - **IF EXISTS**: Read contracts/ for API specifications and test requirements\n   - **IF EXISTS**: Read research.md for technical decisions and constraints\n   - **IF EXISTS**: Read quickstart.md for integration scenarios\n\n4. **Project Setup Verification**:\n   - **REQUIRED**: Create/verify ignore files based on actual project setup:\n\n   **Detection & Creation Logic**:\n   - Check if the following command succeeds to determine if the repository is a git repo (create/verify .gitignore if so):\n\n     ```sh\n     git rev-parse --git-dir 2>/dev/null\n     ```\n\n   - Check if Dockerfile* exists or Docker in plan.md → create/verify .dockerignore\n   - Check if .eslintrc* exists → create/verify .eslintignore\n   - Check if eslint.config.* exists → ensure the config's `ignores` entries cover required patterns\n   - Check if .prettierrc* exists → create/verify .prettierignore\n   - Check if .npmrc or package.json exists → create/verify .npmignore (if publishing)\n   - Check if terraform files (*.tf) exist → create/verify .terraformignore\n   - Check if .helmignore needed (helm charts present) → create/verify .helmignore\n\n   **If ignore file already exists**: Verify it contains essential patterns, append missing critical patterns only\n   **If ignore file missing**: Create with full pattern set for detected technology\n\n   **Common Patterns by Technology** (from plan.md tech stack):\n   - **Node.js/JavaScript/TypeScript**: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `*.log`, `.env*`\n   - **Python**: `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`, `.venv/`, `venv/`, `dist/`, `*.egg-info/`\n   - **Java**: `target/`, `*.class`, `*.jar`, `.gradle/`, `build/`\n   - **C#/.NET**: `bin/`, `obj/`, `*.user`, `*.suo`, `packages/`\n   - **Go**: `*.exe`, `*.test`, `vendor/`, `*.out`\n   - **Ruby**: `.bundle/`, `log/`, `tmp/`, `*.gem`, `vendor/bundle/`\n   - **PHP**: `vendor/`, `*.log`, `*.cache`, `*.env`\n   - **Rust**: `target/`, `debug/`, `release/`, `*.rs.bk`, `*.rlib`, `*.prof*`, `.idea/`, `*.log`, `.env*`\n   - **Kotlin**: `build/`, `out/`, `.gradle/`, `.idea/`, `*.class`, `*.jar`, `*.iml`, `*.log`, `.env*`\n   - **C++**: `build/`, `bin/`, `obj/`, `out/`, `*.o`, `*.so`, `*.a`, `*.exe`, `*.dll`, `.idea/`, `*.log`, `.env*`\n   - **C**: `build/`, `bin/`, `obj/`, `out/`, `*.o`, `*.a`, `*.so`, `*.exe`, `Makefile`, `config.log`, `.idea/`, `*.log`, `.env*`\n   - **Swift**: `.build/`, `DerivedData/`, `*.swiftpm/`, `Packages/`\n   - **R**: `.Rproj.user/`, `.Rhistory`, `.RData`, `.Ruserdata`, `*.Rproj`, `packrat/`, `renv/`\n   - **Universal**: `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`, `*.tmp`, `*.swp`, `.vscode/`, `.idea/`\n\n   **Tool-Specific Patterns**:\n   - **Docker**: `node_modules/`, `.git/`, `Dockerfile*`, `.dockerignore`, `*.log*`, `.env*`, `coverage/`\n   - **ESLint**: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `coverage/`, `*.min.js`\n   - **Prettier**: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `coverage/`, `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`\n   - **Terraform**: `.terraform/`, `*.tfstate*`, `*.tfvars`, `.terraform.lock.hcl`\n   - **Kubernetes/k8s**: `*.secret.yaml`, `secrets/`, `.kube/`, `kubeconfig*`, `*.key`, `*.crt`\n\n5. Parse tasks.md structure and extract:\n   - **Task phases**: Setup, Tests, Core, Integration, Polish\n   - **Task dependencies**: Sequential vs parallel execution rules\n   - **Task details**: ID, description, file paths, parallel markers [P]\n   - **Execution flow**: Order and dependency requirements\n\n6. Execute implementation following the task plan:\n   - **Phase-by-phase execution**: Complete each phase before moving to the next\n   - **Respect dependencies**: Run sequential tasks in order, parallel tasks [P] can run together  \n   - **Follow TDD approach**: Execute test tasks before their corresponding implementation tasks\n   - **File-based coordination**: Tasks affecting the same files must run sequentially\n   - **Validation checkpoints**: Verify each phase completion before proceeding\n\n7. Implementation execution rules:\n   - **Setup first**: Initialize project structure, dependencies, configuration\n   - **Tests before code**: If you need to write tests for contracts, entities, and integration scenarios\n   - **Core development**: Implement models, services, CLI commands, endpoints\n   - **Integration work**: Database connections, middleware, logging, external services\n   - **Polish and validation**: Unit tests, performance optimization, documentation\n\n8. Progress tracking and error handling:\n   - Report progress after each completed task\n   - Halt execution if any non-parallel task fails\n   - For parallel tasks [P], continue with successful tasks, report failed ones\n   - Provide clear error messages with context for debugging\n   - Suggest next steps if implementation cannot proceed\n   - **IMPORTANT** For completed tasks, make sure to mark the task off as [X] in the tasks file.\n\n9. Completion validation:\n   - Verify all required tasks are completed\n   - Check that implemented features match the original specification\n   - Validate that tests pass and coverage meets requirements\n   - Confirm the implementation follows the technical plan\n   - Report final status with summary of completed work\n\nNote: This command assumes a complete task breakdown exists in tasks.md. If tasks are incomplete or missing, suggest running `/speckit.tasks` first to regenerate the task list.\n"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"baby on 

Find the highest feature number across all sources for the short-name:\n      - Remote branches: `git ls-remote --heads origin | grep -E 'refs/heads/[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Local branches: `git branch | grep -E '^[* ]*[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Specs directories: Check for directories matching `specs/[0-9]+-<short-name>`\n\n   c. Determine the next available number:\n      - Extract all numbers from all three sources\n      - Find the highest number N\n      - Use N+1 for the new branch number\n\n   d. Run the script `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"make the buttons bigger and at the bottom of the screen. give two homepages to allow for user capture eg ip:8000/suz will log as user suz, ip:8000/josh will log as josh etc.\"` with the calculated number and short-name:\n      - Pass `--number N+1` and `--short-name \"your-short-name\"` along with the feature description\n      - Bash example: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"make the buttons bigger and at the bottom of the screen. give two homepages to allow for user capture eg ip:8000/suz will log as user suz, ip:8000/josh will log as josh etc.\" --json --number 5 --short-name \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\n      - PowerShell example: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"make the buttons bigger and at the bottom of the screen. give two homepages to allow for user capture eg ip:8000/suz will log as user suz, ip:8000/josh will log as josh etc.\" -Json -Number 5 -ShortName \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\n\n   **IMPORTANT**:\n   - Check all three sources (remote branches, local branches, specs directories) to find the highest number\n   - Only match branches/directories with the exact short-name pattern\n   - If no existing branches/directories found with this short-name, start with number 1\n   - You must only ever run this script once per feature\n   - The JSON is provided in the terminal as output - always refer to it to get the actual content you're looking for\n   - The JSON output will contain BRANCH_NAME and SPEC_FILE paths\n   - For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\")\n\n3. Load `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` to understand required sections.\n\n4. Follow this execution flow:\n\n    1.
